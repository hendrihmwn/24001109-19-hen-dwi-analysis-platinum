# Data Cleansing Project

This repository contains the implementation of Sentiment Analysis Prediction Using Neural Network MLP Classifier and LSTM.

## Dependency

This repository requires this following softwares and dependencies to work:

- Python3 (version 3.11)
- Pandas
- Regex Python
- Sqlite3
- Flask
- Flassger
- Sckit Learn
- Tensorflow (version 2.13.1)
- Makefile (not required)

To make work well, install all dependencies first.
